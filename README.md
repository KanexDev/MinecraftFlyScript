# MinecraftFlyScript

Remember to modify the loadAllowedPlayers() method to load the allowed player list from a configuration file or database according to your specific requirements. Players not listed in the allowed player list will receive the "You don't have permission" message when trying to use the commands.

The code for the Minecraft plugin should be saved with a .java file extension. In this case, you would save the file as FlyPlugin.java. Once the plugin code is written and saved, you will need to compile it into a runnable JAR file using a Java development environment such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. The compiled JAR file can then be placed in the plugins folder of your Minecraft server.
